# Simple2DRaycastingLibrary
Hi, this programm is something like a library for ray casting. You can use it for different purposes.
I hope this program will help you in your work and you will actively work with it and make changes. And I can't comment...

P.S. There is a small bug in the code related to the walls, which I called strange, and with the middle ray.
This ray can pass through these walls, although it should not. Bug works when count of rays is odd.
